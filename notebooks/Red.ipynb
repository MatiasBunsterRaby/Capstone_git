    "\n",
    "**Qué es**: La correlación de Pearson mide la relación lineal entre dos conjuntos de datos. En este caso, mediría cómo se correlacionan los porcentajes de las etiquetas temáticas entre dos programas de gobierno.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aplicación**: Para cada par de programas de gobierno (por ejemplo, \"Chile_1990\" y \"Alemania_1980\"), calcula la correlación de Pearson usando sus respectivos vectores de porcentajes de las 56 etiquetas temáticas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Si el vector de \"Chile_1990\" es `[x1,x2,...,x56]` y el de \"Alemania_1980\" es `[y1,y2,...,y56]`, entonces la correlación de Pearson se calcula como:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{56} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{56} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{56} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Donde $\\bar{x}$ y $\\bar{y}$ son las medias de los vectores de porcentajes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretación de la Correlación:\n",
    "El valor de $r$ está en el rango $[-1,1]$, donde:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $r = 1$ indica una correlación positiva perfecta (discursos muy similares en la distribución temática).\n",
    "- $r = -1$ indica una correlación negativa perfecta (discursos temáticamente opuestos).\n",
    "- $r \\approx 0$ indica que no hay una correlación lineal significativa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uso en la Red de Similaridad:\n",
    "Usaremos el valor absoluto de la correlación ($|r|$) para ponderar la arista entre dos programas. Valores cercanos a 1 indican una fuerte similaridad temática, mientras que valores cercanos a 0 indican poca o ninguna similaridad.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>En realidad, <strong>sí deberían variar las métricas de centralidad</strong> al cambiar el <code>threshold</code>. Aquí está la explicación de por qué:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Efecto del <code>threshold</code></h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>El <code>threshold</code> determina qué conexiones (o enlaces) se incluyen en el grafo. Si aumentas o disminuyes el <code>threshold</code>, estarás modificando la estructura del grafo al agregar o eliminar enlaces entre los nodos en función de la correlación.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Esto significa que al variar el <code>threshold</code>, la cantidad de conexiones entre nodos cambiará, lo cual influye directamente en cómo se calculan las métricas de centralidad.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Cambios en Degree Centrality</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Degree Centrality</strong> depende del número de conexiones directas de un nodo. Si aumentas el <code>threshold</code>, es probable que se eliminen algunas conexiones más débiles, reduciendo el número de conexiones directas de ciertos nodos. Por lo tanto, el <strong>Degree Centrality</strong> de algunos nodos disminuirá al aumentar el <code>threshold</code> y podría aumentar al reducirlo.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Cambios en Betweenness Centrality</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Betweenness Centrality</strong> mide cuántos caminos cortos pasan a través de un nodo. Si los enlaces se eliminan debido a un aumento en el <code>threshold</code>, los caminos más cortos entre nodos también se verán afectados. Algunos nodos que antes conectaban dos partes de la red podrían dejar de hacerlo, disminuyendo su <strong>Betweenness Centrality</strong>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Cambios en Closeness Centrality</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Closeness Centrality</strong> se basa en la distancia promedio entre un nodo y todos los demás. Si se eliminan enlaces al aumentar el <code>threshold</code>, la distancia entre nodos podría incrementarse. Esto afectará las distancias mínimas y, por lo tanto, la <strong>Closeness Centrality</strong> cambiará al variar el <code>threshold</code>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Resumen</h3>\n",
    "<p>Cuando cambias el <code>threshold</code>, la estructura de la red se modifica (al agregar o eliminar enlaces). Dado que todas las métricas de centralidad dependen de la estructura de la red, es <strong>esperable que las métricas de centralidad cambien</strong> en función del <code>threshold</code>. Por eso, si el <code>threshold</code> varía, las métricas que calculaste también podrían cambiar.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Espero que esta explicación te ayude a comprender cómo afecta el <code>threshold</code> a las métricas de centralidad.</p>\n"
