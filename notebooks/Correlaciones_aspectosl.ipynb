    "#### **Introducción**: Se estima que los programas de gobiernmo de un país tienen alguna relación con los programas de gobierno de otros países que los antecedieron. Por ejemplo, Nueva Zelanda abordó el aspecto de 'Pueblos Originarios' con anterioridad a Chile de una manera considerada 'exitosa'. En Chile este aspecto ha permeado en los programas de Gobierno con fuerza desde 1989(*) en adelante; entonces es esperable que los programas de gobierno de Chile en lo relacionado con 'Pueblos Originarios' hayan sido incorporados en los programas de gobierno influidos por la experiencia de Nueva Zelanda."

    "\n",
    "**Aplicación**: Para cada par de programas de gobierno (por ejemplo, \"Chile_1990\" y \"Alemania_1980\"), calcula la correlación de Pearson usando sus respectivos vectores de porcentajes de las 56 etiquetas temáticas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Si el vector de \"Chile_1990\" es `[x1,x2,...,x56]` y el de \"Alemania_1980\" es `[y1,y2,...,y56]`, entonces la correlación de Pearson se calcula como:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "- $r = -1$ indica una correlación negativa perfecta (discursos temáticamente opuestos).\n",
    "- $r \\approx 0$ indica que no hay una correlación lineal significativa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uso en la Red de Similaridad:\n",
    "Usaremos el valor absoluto de la correlación ($|r|$) para ponderar la arista entre dos programas. Valores cercanos a 1 indican una fuerte similaridad temática, mientras que valores cercanos a 0 indican poca o ninguna similaridad.\n",
